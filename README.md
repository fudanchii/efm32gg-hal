`efm32hg-hal`
-------------

This is an implementation of the [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) API for EFM32HG series of MCUs,
and is based on [`efm32gg-hal`](https://github.com/chrysn/efm32gg-hal) implementation.

This will eventually merged back with `efm32gg-hal` into unified `em32-hal`,
but until then, we will keep `efm32hg-hal` specific implementation separated in this repo.
